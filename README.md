## 👋  Hello and Thanks for viewing! Best Of Orlando is another SVG project family animated affair.

#### An Illustrator file my brother Brian allowed me to have to work om my GSAP3 animation skills.
### First Brian created this beautiful SVG and sent it to me in an adobe illustrator file.🌱 (as a one piece grouped SVG)
- 🌱  Then, I took the file from Adobe Illustrator and exported it as an SVG. 
- 🌱  I opened VSCode and the terminal and ran the command `mkdir BestOfOrlando` and then the command `cd BestOfOrlando`
- 🌱  Next, I created a repository in github called jnutt367/Resolutions and inside the VSCode terminal had git initialize it for me with `git init`
- 🌱 I followed the new repository from the command line instructions to the letter

- 🌱  After that, I created the index.html file for the project. And embedded the SVG as one document inside the HTML page.
- - 🌱  Ran the cmd `git add *` `git commit -m "first commit"` and then `git push -u`
- From there on any changes rewuire a `git add *` a `git commit -m "  "` and a `git push -u` to push the changes to github...
- 🌱  Now comes the fun part!!..Grouping all relative components in order to grab them for animations.
- 🌱 Then I embedded the gsap3 script tag and the gsap3 file script tag
- 🌱 Made a detailed Mockup and story boarded out how the animations should be ordered. 
- 🌱 Implemented said animation through trials and tesing out different timelines in gsap3.
- 🌱 Hosted and deployed with Github Pages
